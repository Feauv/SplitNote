# SplitNote - iOS Application

SplitNote is a mobile application that allows you to record audio with real time speech to text transcription. While recording is occurring the user will also be able to highlight sections of the recorded audio/text. Once the recording is finished and saved users will be able to view the notes details which will include a copy of the recorded audio, the full transcription of the audio, user notes, and the highlighted sections of the transcribed text with timestamps for the audio.

#### Features
